# The report viewer

`complydoc ui` opens the report viewer on the reports in a folder, served from
this machine:

```bash
complydoc audit ./documents
complydoc ui
```

```
2 reports in .complydoc
Viewer  http://127.0.0.1:8500/  Ctrl+C stops it
```

It lists every audit report it finds under `.complydoc`, where an audit writes
when no `--out` is given, grouped by the folder each one audited, newest run
first. Two runs of the same folder show what changed between them. A report
written while the viewer runs appears when the page is reloaded.

Name report files or other folders to open those instead:

```bash
complydoc ui reports/ baseline.json
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port`, `-p` | 8500 | The port to serve on. The next free one is used when it is taken |
| `--no-browser` | | Print the address without opening the browser |

## What the viewer shows

The same report as the HTML file an audit writes, drawn differently: a summary,
every finding linked to its page, the cost of each model under a loading plan,
and each document's readings side by side or as a diff. A page picture needs a
report taken with them:

```bash
complydoc audit ./documents --page-images --detail full
```

Without pictures, the readings still sit side by side, and the page pane says how
to get them.

## From Python

`launch_ui` does the same from a script or a notebook, and returns while the
viewer runs in the background:

```python
import complydoc as cd

viewer = cd.launch_ui(".complydoc")
viewer.url      # http://127.0.0.1:8500/
viewer.stop()
```

`block=True` serves in the calling thread instead, and `open_browser=False`
leaves the browser alone.

## What it does not do

- It listens on 127.0.0.1, so nothing else on the network can reach it.
- It answers only requests addressed to this machine by name, so a web page
  elsewhere cannot read the reports through it.
- It serves the viewer and the reports it found, nothing else from the disk.
- Neither the server nor the viewer makes an outbound connection.

The viewer ships inside the package, built. In a checkout of the repository,
`make viewer-bundle` builds it there first.
